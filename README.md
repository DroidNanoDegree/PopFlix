Hello there,

The project in this folder contains the implementation for *Stage 1:  Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings* part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

As per the requirement for the project, the following items are completed:

1. Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
2. Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:

	   * The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
3. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:

	   * original title
	   * movie poster image thumbnail
	   * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
	   * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
	   * release date

**NOTE:**
In order to successfully build and run the project the API key for [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) needs to be set. Follow the steps below to set up the `tmdb_api_key`:

    1. Create a file name *keys.properties*
    2. Make an entry `tmdb_api_key=ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
    3. Profit!
